### Shimmer

The `Shimmer` control shows a lightweight skeleton while your content is loading. It inspects the visual tree beneath it to draw shapes that match controls, then animates a gradient sweep over the placeholders.

## Layout Panels

### ArcPanel

The `ArcPanel` arranges items along an arc (partial circle). Useful for semi-circular menus, dial interfaces, or decorative layouts.

### AutoLayout

A specialized panel reproducing Figma's Auto Layout behavior (Orientation, Spacing, Padding, Alignment).

### BubblePanel

The `BubblePanel` packs circular items using a circle packing algorithm, creating a dense, organic bubble arrangement.

### CircularPanel

The `CircularPanel` arranges items evenly around a circle. Perfect for radial menus, clock faces, or circular arrangements.

### HexPanel

The `HexPanel` arranges items in a honeycomb hexagonal grid. It supports both flat-topped and pointy-topped hexagons.

### LoopPanel

The `LoopPanel` creates an infinite scrolling experience where children wrap seamlessly. It supports drag gestures, mouse wheel, momentum (inertia), and snap-to-item behavior.

### OrbitPanel

The `OrbitPanel` arranges child elements in concentric orbit rings around a center point. Items are distributed evenly radiating from the center.

### OverlapPanel

The `OverlapPanel` stacks children with configurable X/Y offsets, creating card pile or layered effects.

### RadialPanel

The `RadialPanel` positions items in a circular or spiral fan arrangement. It supports configurable radius, start/sweep angles, and item rotation.

### ResponsivePanel

The `ResponsivePanel` is an adaptive panel that toggles visibility of children based on breakpoints (Mobile/Desktop switching).

### StaggeredPanel

The `StaggeredPanel` positions items in a staggered grid, creating a masonry-like effect by filling the shortest column first.

### TimelinePanel

The `TimelinePanel` arranges items in a timeline or step-by-step flow with connecting lines between items.

### VariableSizeWrapPanel

The `VariableSizeWrapPanel` arranges varying-sized items in a wrapping grid, permitting items to span multiple rows and columns similar to the Windows Start Screen.
